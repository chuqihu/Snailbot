# Week 9 (4/3 - 4/10)
## Completed Tasks
We redesigned the base of the chassis using Adobe Illustrator (revised the sizes and placed the holes for the screws) and had the innovation lab lazer cuted out this wooden board. We started to assemble our final robot. Now, most of the wiring is done and parts are attached.

## Problems and Solutions

#### 1
When we tried to screw in the motor mounts to the board, we realized that the holes on the board weren't perfectly alligned with the holes on the motor mounts. To solved this, we asked Carl to help us cut the holes a bit bigger in the direction needed.
#### 2
The robot wasn't going straight when we tested it and it didn't seem to be caused by the motor since the direction was unpredicatable and sometimes the robot would also get stuck. We think there are three possible causes: 1) the weight distribution of the robot. 2) the ball bearing 3) the height of the wheel to the ground. 

To solve this problem, we started by taking out the ball bearing and it turned out that the robot was going more straight - but the back of the robot was dragging on the ground. We tried lubricating the ball, adjusting its height to ground, but nothing worked. So, we decided to changing the ball bearing. However, we cound't find one as the same size, so we ended up using a smaller but smoother ball bearing. NThen, the problem became how to attach the ball bearing to our robot.We ended up created a pressure fit using the foam, and screwed the ball bearing on it. When we tested it, we found that the robot was making weird squezzing sound and that it was not running straight. We thought it was because the foam we used was too squeezable, so we changed to creating the pressure fit by piling up the black cardboard. It turned out solving the problem. 

We are also in the process of printing out new motor mounts whose heights haven been lowered - we want to see if it will help us create smoother drive. For the weight distribution part, we wanted to wait until we have the brush mechanism ready. Then we can counterbalance our robot.
