# Week 8 (3/28 - 4/2)
## Completed Tasks

We finally have almost all the parts we need to build our final robot (specifically, every part it needs to move). This weekend we began putting everything together.

## Problems and Solutions

On the behavior side of things, the main issue weâ€™re still having is the robots inconsistency in recognizing the center yellow and orange lines. In order to combat this, we are implementing a calibration mode that can be activated via a button. Each button press calibrates the Adafruit sensors for a different color (white, orange, yellow, and black). We hope this will improve the consistency. However, we see it necessary to first put together the new chassis before determining our values for this.

## Milestones

We are beginning to look at the milestones where we need to win an expected number of points. With our current strategy of pushing dice off the board. 

## Acknowledgements

Chaz worked on printing the back shelf part of the chasis and modeling and laser cutting the pieces. Sudais worked on beginning the calibration mode and Chuqi worked on refining the camera calibration for dice detection.
