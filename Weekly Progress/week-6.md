# Week 6 (2/28 - 3/6)
## Completed Tasks
For the coding part, we focused on integrating the different parts of the codes and troubleshotting. By the end of the week, we had a relatively functional robot. The next step would be optimize the functions and find ways to let the robot not react to dices out of boundary and dices on the other side of the arena.
## Problems and Solutions
###### 
We found that the after pushing the dice out of boundary, our code let the robot to turn either left or right until an dice is seen. However, this imposes an problem since right now the robot would react to the dice that it just pushed out. Until we find a way for the robot to distinguish the location of the dices, we have agreed that the best solution is to let the robot turn a certain degree so that it does not see that dice and then react to other dices.
