# Week 12 (4/25 - 5/1)
## Completed Tasks

This week, we implemented a new calibration mode with advice from Professor deLeeuw. We also implemented our game plan: go to the opponent's side, collect and push dices out in the opponent's side, when its about 75s, look for the middle line and come back.

We also switched out the ball berring from under our robot to a larger one after modifying the casing and the cavity it sat it so that the ball is not pinched and can roll freely.

Our roller brush finally arrived. The mechanism for mounting the roller brush involves two cases on either side of the robot over both the color sensors. One casing holds a motor that will spin the brush while the other holds a mount for the brush to rest on and allows it to rotate freely and steadliy. Metallic casings were used to increase the surface are of the brush "handle" that would be attacthed to the motor via a servo fin. This fin was glued to the metallic casing of the brush and later a screw was added to keep the brush attatched to the motor. The brush itself is a cylindrical brush with bristles all the way around. We modfified it by taking off some bristles near the end so that they would not rub against the mounts and cutting a knotch large enough for dice to fit in so that they can be scooped up when the brush spins. We started with one knotch and planned to have multiple, but one knotch ended up working very well so we may not need to add more now.

## Problems and Solutions
#### 1
The main hardware issue we faced this week was attatching the brush. We needed to create something that could both mount the brush to the motor and something to balance it out on the far end of the brush. As mentioned, we first had to find casing that would fit the handle side of the  brush. We tried hammering on one first but this only bent the wire brush. However, we were able to find two pieces that could be glued/screwed together to fit. A servo fin was then cut down and glued to the casings on the brush. This fit on the servo by itself, but the hold was not very firm even with the support from the other mount and kept coming off. This was fixed by taking the fin off the brush and adding a screw that can be used to keep it mounted on the servo. Then, the brush was glued back to the fin over the csrews and the brush now stays firmly even when put under the preassure of several dice. 

#### 2
After we attached the brush, we found that the red brush was appearing in the camera's view. We ended up raising up the camera by creating a mount using lego parts and it solved the problem.
